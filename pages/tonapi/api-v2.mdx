TODO: Add description
**TONAPI** provides a comprehensive set of APIs for interacting with the TON blockchain. These APIs enable developers to query blockchain data, send transactions, and interact with smart contracts. The **Blockchain** service includes the following APIs:


### Gasless

[openapi](http://localhost:3001/api-v2#operations-tag-Gasless)

**Gasless transactions** on the TON platform enable users to send transactions without paying gas fees directly from their wallets. This is achieved using **Signed Internal Messages** sent through a **gas proxy contract**, which covers the transaction fees on behalf of the user. This approach simplifies blockchain interactions, making it easier for users who may not have TON tokens in their wallets.

#### Architecture

Gasless transactions leverage **Signed Internal Messages**. These messages are signed by the user but routed through a smart contract that pays the fees using a **gas proxy**. This eliminates the need for users to hold TON tokens for transaction fees.

**TONAPI** plays a critical role by simulating transaction execution to accurately estimate fees and sending the transaction to multiple validators to increase the chances of successful processing. Additionally, **TONAPI** ensures that the userâ€™s wallet and gas proxy contract are in the same shard, minimizing latency and ensuring fast transaction processing.

#### Process for Executing

1. **Fetch Configuration:** Request the gasless transaction parameters using `/v2/gasless/config`.
2. **Estimate Transaction:** Send a POST request to `/v2/gasless/estimate/{master_id}` to receive a payload for signing.
3. **Sign Payload:** Sign the received payload with your private key.
4. **Send Transaction:** Submit the signed message via POST to `/v2/gasless/send`.

#### Implementation Examples

- **TypeScript:** See an implementation example for gasless transactions in TypeScript [here](/tonapi/recipes#gasless-transfer).
- **Go:** Find the Go implementation example [here](/tonapi/recipes#gasless-transfer).

These examples will help developers integrate gasless transactions into their applications.
