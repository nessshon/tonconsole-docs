# REST API

## Introduction

## Services

### Accounts <SwaggerLink tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.ACCOUNTS} />

**Accounts** service provide API access to structured account information within the TON network. Allows retrieval of data such as balance, transaction history, DNS, multisigs, NFTs, Jettons, and other account-related details without dealing with low-level specifics. All data is regularly updated and can be used to build applications that require accurate and up-to-date account information.

#### Operations

<SchemaLoader tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.ACCOUNTS} />

### Blockchain <SwaggerLink tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.BLOCKCHAIN} />

**Blockchain** service provide low-level access to the TON blockchain, allowing developers to retrieve detailed information about blocks, transactions, accounts, and more. These endpoints are essential for building tools that require in-depth blockchain data and are critical for applications that need to interact closely with the TON blockchain.

**TONAPI** ensures that data retrieved from the blockchain is accurate and up-to-date by continuously indexing the blockchain and maintaining a low-latency connection to the TON network.

#### Operations

<SchemaLoader tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.BLOCKCHAIN} />

### Gasless <SwaggerLink tag={SWAGGER_TAGS.GASLESS} />

**Gasless transactions** on the TON platform enable users to send transactions without paying gas fees directly from their wallets. This is achieved using **Signed Internal Messages** sent through a **gas proxy contract**, which covers the transaction fees on behalf of the user. This approach simplifies blockchain interactions, making it easier for users who may not have TON tokens in their wallets.

This service only works with [W5 wallets](https://github.com/tonkeeper/w5/blob/main/Specification.md)

#### Architecture

Gasless transactions leverage **Signed Internal Messages**. These messages are signed by the user but routed through a smart contract that pays the fees using a **gas proxy**. This eliminates the need for users to hold TON tokens for transaction fees.

**TONAPI** plays a critical role by simulating transaction execution to accurately estimate fees and sending the transaction to multiple validators to increase the chances of successful processing. Additionally, **TONAPI** ensures that the userâ€™s wallet and gas proxy contract are in the same shard, minimizing latency and ensuring fast transaction processing.

#### Process for Executing

1. **Fetch Configuration:** Request the gasless transaction parameters using `/v2/gasless/config`.
2. **Estimate Transaction:** Send a POST request to `/v2/gasless/estimate/{master_id}` to receive a payload for signing.
3. **Sign Payload:** Sign the received payload with your private key.
4. **Send Transaction:** Submit the signed message via POST to `/v2/gasless/send`.

#### Implementation Examples

- **TypeScript:** See an implementation example for gasless transactions in TypeScript [here](/tonapi/recipes#gasless-transfer).
- **Go:** Find the Go implementation example [here](/tonapi/recipes#gasless-transfer).
