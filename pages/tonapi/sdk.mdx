# TonAPI SDK Guide

TonAPI provides a set of tools and libraries to simplify the integration with the TON blockchain. This guide covers both official and third-party SDKs available for different programming languages, as well as instructions on how to generate an SDK yourself using the provided Swagger specification.

## Official SDKs

We maintain several pre-built SDKs for various programming languages. All of these SDKs are generated from our Swagger files and are optimized for seamless integration into your projects.

- **Golang SDK**: [tonapi-go](https://github.com/tonkeeper/tonapi-go)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**: [tonapi-sdk-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tonapi-sdk-js)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Client (compatible with @ton/core)**: [@ton-api/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-api/client)

#### Ton Adapter (Compatible with `@ton/ton`)

The [@ton-api/ton-adapter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-api/ton-adapter) allows you to integrate TonAPI projects that use `@ton/ton`, enhancing your application with additional blockchain features while maintaining compatibility with `@ton/ton`.

## Third-Party SDKs

These SDKs are maintained by the community and provide additional language support:

- **Python SDK**: [pytonapi on GitHub](https://github.com/tonkeeper/pytonapi)

## Generating an SDK Using the Swagger File

If you prefer to generate an SDK yourself, you can do so using the TonAPI Swagger specification. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the Swagger Codegen CLI Tool:**

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/master/bin/swagger-codegen-cli.jar
   ```

2. **Generate the SDK:**
   Use the command below to generate the SDK. The example is for Python, but you can specify a different language by changing the `-l` parameter.

   ```bash
   java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonkeeper/opentonapi/master/api/openapi.yml -l python -o /path/to/output
   ```

   - **Note:** Replace `/path/to/output` with the actual directory path where you want to generate the SDK.
   - **Prerequisites:** Ensure that a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is installed on your system to run the command.

For more information on available options and supported languages, refer to the [Swagger Codegen documentation](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/).
