# Deep Linking into Tonkeeper

</Callout>

Your application might operate outside of Tonkeeper, like a website or a mobile app. Deep links allow you to seamlessly direct users back to a meaningful location within the Tonkeeper app.

## Deep linking with `tonkeeper://`

Use the `tonkeeper://` URI scheme to deep link into a user's Tonkeeper client on the following platforms:

- **Mobile clients**:
  - iPhone
  - Android

### Supported URI Schemes

Tonkeeper supports multiple URI schemes, allowing for flexibility depending on the context in which the link is used. The following schemes are supported:

- **`ton://`**: This scheme is part of the broader TON blockchain standard, enabling interoperability across different TON-based wallets and services.
- **`tonkeeper://`**: A custom URI scheme specifically for deep linking into the Tonkeeper app.
- **`https://app.tonkeeper.com/`**: A web-based scheme that can be used in browsers and other environments that do not support custom URI schemes.

All three schemes are interchangeable and serve similar purposes, directing users to specific actions or pages within Tonkeeper.

### Supported URIs

For each supported action, the structure of the URI is the same across all three schemes. Replace `{PREFIX}` with the desired scheme (`ton://`, `tonkeeper://`, or `https://app.tonkeeper.com/`).

#### **Transfer**

**1. Open Transfer Screen**

**Description:** Opens the pre-filled Send screen and prompts the user to enter the missing data.

- **Format:**
  ```
  {PREFIX}transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}
  ```
- **Parameters:**
  - `{ADDRESS}` (required): The recipient's TON address.
  - `amount` (optional): The amount of TON to send, in nanocoins.
  - `text` (optional): A URL-encoded UTF-8 text message to attach to the transfer.

**Examples:**

- **Address only:** 
  ```
  ton://transfer/{ADDRESS}
  tonkeeper://transfer/{ADDRESS}
  https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/{ADDRESS}
  ```
- **Address + Amount:** 
  ```
  {PREFIX}transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}
  ```
- **Address + Text:** 
  ```
  {PREFIX}transfer/{ADDRESS}?text={TEXT}
  ```
- **Address + Amount + Text:** 
  ```
  {PREFIX}transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}
  ```

##### **2. Address with Encrypted Comment**

**Description:** Opens the Send screen with a pre-filled encrypted comment. This can be done using either `https://app.tonkeeper.com/` or `tonkeeper://` schemes.

TODO: no support for `ton://` scheme???

- **Format:**
  ```
  tonkeeper://transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&bin={BINARY_DATA}
  ```
  ```
  https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&bin={BINARY_DATA}
  ```

- **Parameters:**
  - `{ADDRESS}` (required): The recipient's TON address.
  - `amount` (optional): The amount of TON to send, in nanocoins.
  - `bin` (optional): Encrypted binary data to include in the transaction.

### Standard Reference

The `ton://` scheme is part of the broader TON blockchain standard, which defines how TON-based applications and services should implement deep linking. You can learn more about the TON standard and its URI scheme by visiting the official documentation [here](https://docs.ton.org/).

### Example Workflows

- **Quick Payments:** Integrate payment requests directly from your website, allowing users to complete transactions with a single tap using any of the supported URI schemes.
- **In-app Transactions:** Use deep links to facilitate seamless transfers between users within your application.
- **Cross-Wallet Compatibility:** Utilize the `ton://` scheme to ensure compatibility with other TON-based wallets and services.

##### **3. Expiry Timestamp**

**Description:** Opens the Send screen with an expiry timestamp for the transaction.

- **Format:**
  ```
  https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}&exp={EXPIRY_TIMESTAMP}
  ```
- **Parameters:**
  - `{ADDRESS}` (required): The recipient's TON address.
  - `amount` (optional): The amount of TON to send, in nanocoins.
  - `text` (optional): A URL-encoded UTF-8 text message to attach to the transfer.
  - `exp` (optional): Expiry timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch.

**Example:**
```
https://app.tonkeeper.com/transfer/EQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOG21n?amount=100000&text=test&exp=500
```

### External Deep Links

Tonkeeper supports integration with other TON services through similar deep linking structures.

#### **Tonhub**

**Description:** Tonhub also supports deep linking for transfers, compatible with Tonkeeper.

- **Format:**
  ```
  https://tonhub.com/transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}
  ```

**Examples:**
```
https://tonhub.com/transfer/EQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOG21n
https://tonhub.com/transfer/EQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOG21n?amount=10000
https://tonhub.com/transfer/EQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOG21n?text=just%20message
https://tonhub.com/transfer/EQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOG21n?amount=7000&text=just%20message
```

#### **Ton.app**

**Description:** Ton.app allows users to initiate transfers through its deep linking structure.

- **Format:**
  ```
  https://ton.app/pay/transfer/{ADDRESS}?amount={AMOUNT}&text={TEXT}
  ```

**Examples:**
```
https://ton.app/pay/transfer/UQD2NmD_lH5f5u1Kj3KfGyTvhZSX0Eg6qp2a5IQUKXxOGzCi?amount=1000000000&text=qwerty
```

### Example Workflows

- **Quick Payments:** Integrate payment requests directly from your website, allowing users to complete transactions with a single tap using `tonkeeper://transfer` links.
- **In-app Transactions:** Use deep links to facilitate seamless transfers between users within your application.
- **Link to Specific Transfers:** Provide support or history review by linking directly to specific transactions or transfers.
